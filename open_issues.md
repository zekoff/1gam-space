# Open issues

## Currently working

Refactor the way items are laid out in HUD panel groups so that sub HUD elements
can be placed in a more sane way.

## Todo

- Update starfield as ship travels
- Procedurally generate system contents

## Bugs

- Starfield will still parallax scroll even if camera is pinned to world bounds
