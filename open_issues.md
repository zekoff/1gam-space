# Open issues

## Currently working

Expand procedural generation of planet traits

## Todo

- Add display of planet traits to planet info and docked screens
- Update starfield as ship travels
- Procedurally generate system contents
- Add YES/NO version of results panel
- Refactor status/planet panel in HUD to ease layout
- Add random encounters when traveling between planets
- Add random effects during travel (maybe a function of the above)

## Bugs

- Starfield will still parallax scroll even if camera is pinned to world bounds
