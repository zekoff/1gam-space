# Open issues

## Currently working

Add exploration functions.

## Todo

- Populate HUD with planet info and status info.
- Update starfield as ship travels
- Refactor status/planet panel in HUD to ease layout
- Add random encounters when traveling between planets
- Add random effects during travel (maybe a function of the above)
- Add back ability to pan map
- Draw line between current planet and target planet when on travel screen
- Add contents to status panel.
- Buying goods might still be buggy.

## Bugs

- Starfield will still parallax scroll even if camera is pinned to world bounds
