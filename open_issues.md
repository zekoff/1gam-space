## Currently working

Add random events to travel.

## Todo

- Populate HUD with planet info and status info.
- Update starfield as ship travels
- Refactor status/planet panel in HUD to ease layout. HUD text slides with
these panels. That's weird
- Add random encounters when traveling between planets
- Add random effects during travel (maybe a function of the above)
- Add back ability to pan map
- Add shipyards and upgrade path (progress along defined with shipyard upgrades)
- Draw line between current planet and target planet when on travel screen
- Add contents to status panel.
- Buying goods might still be buggy.
- Variable number of discoveries based on planet size.
- Add end condition (no days left)
- Add "out of money" condition.
- Add 'hidden effects' to planet. (Cached goods, rich history, shipwreck, well-charted, etc.)
- Add random galaxy-level events (food shortage, etc.)
- Add more exploration flavor events

## Bugs

- Starfield will still parallax scroll even if camera is pinned to world bounds
